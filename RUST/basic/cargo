    foo matches any file or directory with the name foo anywhere in the package. This is equivalent to the pattern **/foo.
    /foo matches any file or directory with the name foo only in the root of the package.
    foo/ matches any directory with the name foo anywhere in the package.
    Common glob patterns like *, ?, and [] are supported:
        * matches zero or more characters except /. For example, *.html matches any file or directory with the .html extension anywhere in the package.
        ? matches any character except /. For example, foo? matches food, but not foo.
        [] allows for matching a range of characters. For example, [ab] matches either a or b. [a-z] matches letters a through z.
    **/ prefix matches in any directory. For example, **/foo/bar matches the file or directory bar anywhere that is directly under directory foo.
    /** suffix matches everything inside. For example, foo/** matches all files inside directory foo, including all files in subdirectories below foo.
    /**/ matches zero or more directories. For example, a/**/b matches a/b, a/x/b, a/x/y/b, and so on.
    ! prefix negates a pattern. For example, a pattern of src/*.rs and !foo.rs would match all files with the .rs extension inside the src directory, except for any file named foo.rs.
