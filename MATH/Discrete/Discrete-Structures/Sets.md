## History
**Set** - was first formally introduced in 1879 r. by George Cantor.
## Definition
**Set** - set is collection of elements. e.g.: if $C$ is the set of all countries then a country e.g.: Poland is element of $C$. or if set $I$ is a list of integers from $1$ to $100$ then $34$ is element of $I$. The *axiom of extension* says that a set is completely determined by what its elements are and **not** the order in which they might be listed or the fact that some elements can be listed more than once.
## Set-Roster Notation
- **is in set notation** - if $S$ is a set and $x$ is element of that set we would write it: $x \in S$
- **is not in set notation** - if $S$ is a set and $x$ is **not** element of that set we would write it: $x \notin S$
- **specifying sets** - to specify a set you can write it's elements between a braces e.g.: to specify a set $S$ with elements $1, 2, 3, 4,$ we would write $S = \{1,2,3,4\}$ if a set is large or for some other reason we don't want to list all of its elements we can use $...$ (*ellipsis*) e.g.: $S = \{1,2,3,...,100\}$ which means elements of set $S$ are integers from $1$ to $100$. with the same variation of notation we can specify infinite sets e.g.: $S = \{1,2,3,...\}$ which means that elements of set are all integers from $1$ up to $\infty$. The *ellipsis* can be read "and so forth".
## Special sets
Some sets are so frequently refereed to that they are given special symbolic names:
- **$\mathbb{R}$** - Set of all [[Real-numbers|real numbers]]
- **$\mathbb{Z}$** - Set of all [[Integers]]
- **$\mathbb{N}$** - Set of all [[Natural-numbers|Natural numbers]] (*set of non negative integers*)
- **$\mathbb{Q}$** - Set of all [[Rational-numbers|rational numbers]], or quotients of integers
- **$\mathbb{P}$** - Set of all [[Irrational-numbers|irrational numbers]]
- **$\mathbb{C}$** - Set of all [[Complex-numbers|complex numbers]]
Addition of superscript $+$ or $-$ or the letters $nonneg$ indicates that:
- **$+$** - Set consist only of positive elements e.g.: $\mathbb{R}^+$ would mean that we are referring to set of positive real numbers.
- **$-$** - Set consist only of negative elements e.g.: $\mathbb{R}^-$ would mean that we are referring to set of negative real numbers.
- **$nonneg$** - Set consist only of non zero elements e.g.: $\mathbb{Z}^{nonneg}$ would refer to the set of non negative integers.
