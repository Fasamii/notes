## Definition
There are many relations in the world e.g.: we can say that someone is related by blood. But focusing on the math we can say that set $A$ is related to set $B$ which means that e.g.:
- set $A$ is subset of set $B$
- set $A$ is **not** a subset of $B$
- set $A$ and set $B$ have elements in common
You can also tell that number e.g.: $x$ is related to $y$ e.g.:
- we can say that $x \textgreater y$
- $x$ is a factor of $y$
- $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
