## Definition
**Discrete Mathematics** - is a branch of mathematics that focuses on mathematical structures that are countable or distinct. To discrete math belong:
- **[[Basic-Logic-and-Proof|Basic Logic and Proof]]** - most important basic which helps develop ability to think abstractly.
- **[[Induction-and-Recursion|Induction and Recursion]]** - recursive thinking is thinking with assumption that that similar problems of smaller nature have been solved and figuring out how to put those solutions together to solve the larger problem.
- **[[Number-Theory|Number Theory]]** - Studies properties and relations of integers
- **[[What-are-Discrete-Structures|Discrete Structures]]** - abstract structures that: Describe, Categorize, Reveal the underlying relationships among discrete mathematical objects. Key discrete mathematical structures are:
- **[[Discrete-Combinatorics|Discrete Combinatorics]]** - is the mathematics of counting and arranging objects.
- **[[Discrete-Probability|Discrete Probability]]** - is the study of laws concerning the measurement of random or chance events. Discrete probability focuses on situations involving discrete sets of objects.
- **[[Algorithms-and-Analysis|Algorithms and their Analysis]]** - is a step by step instruction to solve problem and analysis of it may be calculating steps it needs to solve problem and comparing it to other algorithms.
- **[[Coding-Theory|Coding Theory]]** - Mathematical study of codes for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, and network communication.
- **[[Applications-and-Modeling|Applications and Modeling]]** - mathematical topics are best understood when the are seen in variety of contexts and the same mathematical model can be used to solve problems in situations that appear to be dissimilar.
