high level programing languages relies on if if-else and else statments. To do that in asm you have to use jump instruction to jump to another
section of the program with te use of jump you can make several branches that help in managing the program workflow

first we must compare some values using the cmpl instruction
this instruction saves output in special %eflags register

there is multiple jump instruction based on cmpl outcome:
	
	- je - jump if vals are equal
	- jg - jump if the second value is greater
	- jge - jump if second value is greater than or equal to the first
	- jl - jump if the second val is less than the first
	- jle - jump if second val is less or equal to first
	- jmp - jump no mater what
